32)AccessSpecifiers
====================
public ,private ,protected, default

Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.

Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class
.
Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.



Note:
1)Yes, we can declare a class as private but these classes can be only inner or nested classes. We canâ€™t a top-level class as private because it would be completely useless as nothing would have access to it.

2)No, we cannot declare a top-level class as private or protected. It can be either public or default (no modifier). If it does not have a modifier, it is supposed to have a default access.30-Jul-2019
