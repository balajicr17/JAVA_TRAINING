JAVA INTRODUCTION
==================
 Java is a simple programing language
 Writing, compilation and debugging a program is very easy in java
 It helps to create reusable code
 Java has more features,

 1. Platform independent
 2. Open source
 3. Multithreading
 4. More secure
 5. Portable 


1. Platform independent
=======================
 During the compilation the java program converts into byte code
 Using byte code we can run the application to any platform such as windows, mac, linux, etc

2. Open source:
=================
 A program in which source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification
from its original design at free of cost is called open source

3. Multithreading:
===================
 Java supports multithreading
 It enables a program to perform several task simultaneously

4. More secure:
===============
 It provides the virtual firewall between the application and the computer
 So it’s doesn't grant unauthorized access

5. Portable:
============
 "Write once run anywhere"
 Java code written in one machine can run on another machine
