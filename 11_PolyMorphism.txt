PolyMorphism:
============

***Executing the methods more than once which is known as Polymorphism.

Two types of Polymorphism we have.
=================================
1) Compile Time polymorphism-Method Overloading
2) Run Time Polymorphism-> Method Overriding.


Compile Time polymorphism-Method Overloading
=============================================

1) Same class have to use
2) Same Mehtods we have to use
3) Need to pass different type of data or arguments inside methods


Method Overriding:
=================

1)Different Class
2)Same method we have to use
3)It omits the parent clsas methods
4)It accepts child class methods
5) "extends" keyword to override from any parent class.(kind of Inheritence)
